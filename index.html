However, for the rest of the countries, it ends with a virus icon. If the arrowhead symbolises something, there should be a clearer legend indicating its purpose, else all lines should end with a virus icon to ensure overall consistency in the representation.</li>

                            <li>Each country has a different end date (e.g. USA ends on 3rd April while England and Wales end on 10th April). All of the countries should have the same end date to prevent any incorrect comparisons</li>

                            <li>Some of the points along the chart have date labels associated with the points whereas others are missing the date labels. The graph should either contain all the date labels for the points or have a legend to display the date for each of the different points. Alternatively, only display the dates that are significant.</li>

                            <li>Inconsistent usage of numbers (e.g. “2” weeks for Spain and “two” weeks for the other countries) and text (Year is shown on the description text for Italy [Orange tag], whereas the years are not shown for the other countries). There should be some form of standardisation to ensure overall consistency in the graph.</li>

                                The team recommends having a line chart with the x-axis as the date and the y-axis as the average number of deaths. The increase or decrease in the number of deaths per day will be represented by how much the line moves up/down.

                            <li>There is some slight inconsistency in the images depicted in the graph (e.g. The image shown for Jeff Bezos in 2016 is different from the one shown in 2019, whereas the images for the other billionaires remained the same).</li>

                            <li>During the time period of 1988 - 2018, there are random image depictions of different billionaires in the graph. The visualisation should either display all the images of the billionaires present in the respective years or do not display the images at all for overall consistency.</li>

                        </ol>

                                The colour scale provided for the different continents has no context and thus it is difficult to differentiate between the lighter scales from the darker scales. The legend should include a description for each of the colours depicted, or alternatively stick to a single colour to represent each continent.
                            </p></li>

                                It is difficult to visualise the changes in billionaire's wealth over the years since the chart is focused on ranking the top 10 billionaires for each year, while their wealth is only represented through the thickness of the bars (e.g. Warren Buffet's wealth grew from 2017 to 2018, but since he was ranked the 3rd in 2019, it looks as if his wealth had decreased).
                            </p></li>

                            <li><p>
                                It is difficult to tell the position of the person in a respective year (e.g. the 3rd richest person in the world for 1989 is Forrest Mars Sr and Family, but visually it looks like he is in the 4th place).
                            </p></li>
