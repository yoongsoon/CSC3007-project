                                            The team recommends having a line chart with the x-axis as the date and the

                                            number of deaths per day will be represented by how much the line moves

                                    depictions, while others do not.</p>

                                <p>There are some inconsistencies in the images depicted in the graph (e.g. The image

                                <p>The colour scale provided for the different continents provides no context on the
                                    countries they are representing and hence it is difficult to differentiate between
                                    the lighter scales from the darker scales.</p>

                                <p>It is difficult to visualise the changes in the wealth of the billionaires over the
                                    years. This is because the chart is focused on ranking the top 10 billionaires for
                                    each year, with their wealth being represented only through the thickness of the
                                    bars (e.g. Warren Buffet's wealth grew from 2017 to 2018, but since he was ranked
                                    the 3rd in 2019, it looks as if his wealth had decreased).</p>

                                <p>It is difficult to tell the position of the person in a respective year (e.g. the
                                    3rd richest person in the world for 1989 is Forrest Mars Sr and Family, but visually
                                    it looks like he is in the 4th place due to the clutter).</p>

                                            The team recommends having an animated bar chart to show the changes in the
                                            rank of the billionaires as well as their wealth over the years, where the
                                            colour of the bar depicts the country or continent the billionaire is from.
